# CryptoSim
#### A cryptocurrency trading platform using monopoly money and live trading data

## Introduction
There are many entrants into the cryptocurrency investment markets each day. Many of whom don't quite understand the landscape yet. Rather than jumping straight in and potentially losing fiat currency, CryptoSim allows users to **test before they invest**. Upon creating an account, users are given $50,000 in ‘monopoly money’ which they can use to invest in any of the 1,800+ cryptocurrencies available.
